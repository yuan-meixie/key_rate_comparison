amdi_3vs4.pdf shows the key rate comparison  of click filtering asynchronous-MDIQKD by the three-intensity and the four-intensity decoy-state methods.
amid_dsvsnds.pdf shows the key rate comparison of click filtering asynchronous-MDIQKD with and without double-scanning method.


xtoxbzmg.m is used to obtain the upper and lower bounds of expected value for a given observed value x and failure probability; xbtoxzmg.m is used to obtain the upper and lower bounds of observed value for a given expected value x* and failure probability; gazmg.m is random sampling without replacement; H2.m is the binary Shannon entropy function;
